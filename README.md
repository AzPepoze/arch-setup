# az-arch-hyprland Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for Arch Linux, heavily based on [end-4's dotfiles](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland), and configured for a personalized development and desktop experience with the Hyprland window manager (for me specifically).

The setup is designed to be automated, allowing for a quick and easy installation of a complete environment and program on a new system.

## ‚ú® Features

-    **Automated Setup:** Scripts to install [end-4's dotfiles](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland), essential applications, command-line tools, and system services.
-    **Additional Utility Scripts:** A collection of helper scripts for managing the system, handling keybinds, and syncing files.
-    **Cursor** Custom cursor.

The foundation of this setup, especially the Hyprland configuration and overall structure, is heavily inspired by and built upon the excellent work from [end-4's dotfiles](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland).
